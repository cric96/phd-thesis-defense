## A Language-Based Software Engineering Approach for Cyber-Physical Swarms (CPSWs)

This presentation of my PhD addresses the challenges of engineering complex Cyber-Physical Swarms (CPSWs) - systems consisting of numerous interconnected devices exhibiting collective intelligence.

**Key Contributions:**

* **Hybrid Aggregate Computing (HAC):** A novel approach that merges declarative programming (Aggregate Computing) with learning techniques (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) to synthesize and deploy self-organizing behaviors with predictable outcomes.
* **Research Roadmap:** Outlines a systematic methodology to engineer CPSWs, highlighting the interplay between functionality, non-functional requirements, algorithms, execution strategies, and system structures.
* **Specific Algorithms & Techniques:** 
    * **Collective Program Sketching:**  Synthesizes missing program blocks ("holes") through learning from realistic simulations.
    * **Distributed Schedulers:** Employs local decision-making to optimize the execution of aggregate programs.
    * **Field-Informed Reinforcement Learning:** Leverages computational fields from Aggregate Computing to guide and enhance the learning process in multi-agent environments.
* **Engineering Methodologies:**
    * **FRASP (Functional Reactive Approach to Self-Organization Programming):** A distributed programming model inspired by functional reactive programming.
    * **MacroSwarm:** An API for composing complex swarm behaviors.
    * **Additional Methodologies:** Swarm Sensing API, DevOps for CPSWs, abstractions for distributed sensing, and pulverization architecture for deployment.
* **Tools:**
    * **ScaRLib:** A tool for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.
    * **ScaFi-Web:** A web-based simulator for Aggregate Computing.

**Future Directions:**

* Bridge the reality gap by deploying on real CPSWs and improving the toolchain.
* Enhance learning algorithms to learn deployment and runtime adjustments.
* Explore Aggregate Computing to create resilient infrastructures for learning (e.g., federated learning).

**Overall:**

This research provides a comprehensive framework and concrete tools for engineering CPSWs, leveraging a language-based approach that combines programming and learning. It paves the way for building more robust and predictable self-organizing systems in diverse domains.
